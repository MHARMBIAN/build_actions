# This is a workflow to build an bootable Armbian SD card image with a Linux kernel
# and appropriate boot images to setup the NAND on a Cubietruck (SUNXI A20 board)
# for:
#   - SUNXI NAND support within mainline kernel
#   - booting from NAND with mainline U-Boot
#   - have a NAND partition configured for an UBI filesystem
